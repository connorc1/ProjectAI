# ProjectAI

This is my primary project which I work on as a Hobby. Feel free to
look at it. Currently I do not give permission for this project to be
used in commercial projects as it is still very early in development. 

However I give permission for others to obtain a copy and use or modify
it for personal use.

Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project it to build a gaming AI that is as close
to realistic as possible. e.g. A person is not going to clean dishes
when the house is burning down (with the exception of Marge Simpson 
from the Simpsons movie). The code should on completion be easy to 
drop into a project and work in a range of different genres from the 
sims to a survival game.

Project design details: 
Originally the plan was to base the design on the MVC approach however
the design is slipping away from this approach (intentional). OOP is 
still being used as it is a nice way to organise code. Eventually
there will be notes here on the format of coloured debug messages
