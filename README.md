# ProjectAI

This is my primary project which I work on as a Hobby. Feel free to
look at it. Currently I do not give permission for this project to be
used or copied as it is still very early in development. 

Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project it to build a gaming AI that is as close
to realistic as possible. e.g. A person is not going to worry about 
keeping a job and going to work if they are dying of thirst or some 
medical condition. The project should on completion be easy to drop
into a project and work in a range of different genres from the sims
to a survival game.

Project details: 
Using a MVC design to separate some of the code to hopefully make it 
easier to write. OOP shall also be used to some degree to further 
organise code.
